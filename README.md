#Overview of the project
--------------------------------------------------
1.In this project the main aim is to perform various operations on a student database.
2.First we download the required software for our project as stated in the build instructions below.
3.Then we create a page which has options to add and view a student.
4.In the add student page,we are required to enter the basic details such as name,roll number,email address,physical address,department and about the student with some certain validations which should be met by the data we enter.
5.After the data is validated,a randomised passcode has to be displayed to the user and the data along with the passcode has to be stored into the MySQL database.
6.Now in the view student page the details of a student have to be retrieved by using the roll number of the student.
7.In this page an option to edit the details except roll number is to be provided along with the student details 
8.This is the basic idea of adding,viewingand editing a database
